A simple script to practice my python while I automate image building for my
homelab.

Development
===========


Testing
=======

- sample_config_correct.json: A sample configuration complete with all
  defaults.
- sample_config_good.json: A valid configuration.
- sample_config_bad_*.json: Bad configurations, names must start with
  "sample_config_bad_" and should be brief but describe what's bad in the
  configuration. A function should be appended to BadCfgTests for all
  configurations.
